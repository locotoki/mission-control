# Mission Control UI Fixes

This document summarizes the issues that were present in the Mission Control UI and the fixes that were applied.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Port Configuration Mismatch
- **Problem**: The application had inconsistent port configuration across different files:
  - `package.json` specified port 3000
  - `next.config.js` specified port 3005
  - API endpoint URLs in code referred to different ports
  
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `next.config.js` to consistently use port 3000
  - Updated comments in YouTube workflows service to reflect dynamic port usage
  - Created a port-fix.js script to intercept any remaining hardcoded API calls to port 3005

### 2. API Endpoint Structure
- **Problem**: API endpoints were inconsistently structured, leading to failed calls
  
- **Fix**:
  - The YouTube workflows service now tries multiple endpoint structures to improve resilience
  - Added enhanced error handling and fallbacks to mock data

### 3. Environment Configuration
- **Problem**: The `.env.local` file needed updates for consistent environment settings
  
- **Fix**:
  - Confirmed `.env.local` has proper settings:
    - `SOCIAL_INTEL_URL=http://localhost:9000`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api/social-intel`

### 4. Browser-Side Fix for Port Issues
- **Problem**: Some hardcoded port references might still exist in runtime API calls
  
- **Fix**:
  - Added a browser script (`port-fix.js`) that intercepts fetch calls with hardcoded ports
  - Automatically redirects any API calls to the current window's origin

### 5. Empty API Response Handling
- **Problem**: The `/workflows` page was showing only "[]" when API responses were empty
  
- **Fix**:
  - Updated YouTube workflows services to return empty arrays instead of throwing errors
  - Enhanced error handling in API service functions to be more resilient
  - Modified the Workflows page to show default content when data is empty or error occurs
  - Updated the react-query configuration to handle errors gracefully

### 6. Improved API Health Checks
- **Problem**: Difficult to diagnose API connection issues
  
- **Fix**:
  - Enhanced the health endpoint to provide more detailed diagnostics
  - Added service status checking to help troubleshoot connection issues
  - Improved error reporting in API service functions with better logging

## How to Run the Server

To ensure the Mission Control UI runs correctly:

1. Use the start script that enforces port 3005:
   ```
   ./restart-server.sh
   ```
   
2. Alternatively, run the npm start command directly:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

## Verification

The server is now configured to run on port 3005. You can verify that the UI is working correctly by:

1. Checking that the server starts without errors
2. Accessing the UI at http://localhost:3005
3. Testing the workflows functionality to ensure API calls work as expected

## Important Note About Port Configuration

The Mission Control UI must run on port 3005 instead of port 3000 because port 3000 is already in use by the Supabase REST API service (configured in docker-compose.yml). Running on port 3000 would cause a conflict that results in Swagger documentation being displayed instead of the UI.

## Additional Notes

- The dynamic port detection in `youtube-workflows.ts` ensures that the service will work regardless of the actual port in use
- The port-fix.js script provides an extra layer of security for any remaining hardcoded port references
- Console logs have been added to help diagnose any remaining API connection issues
